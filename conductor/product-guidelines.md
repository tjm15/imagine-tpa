# Product Guidelines

## Communication Tone & Style
- **Professional & Procedural:** The system must use clear, objective, and structured language that mirrors planning and legal terminology.
- **Procedural Explainability:** Every statement should be linked to the underlying 8-move grammar trace, ensuring that the "why" is as prominent as the "what."

## UI/UX Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Information should be presented on a spectrum from "Summary" to "Forensic." Users should be able to drill down into the specific evidence atoms without being overwhelmed initially.
- **Usability Without Training:** Despite the high information density, the UI must be intuitive enough for a planner to use effectively on day one.
- **Information Density & Clarity:** Prioritize the clear display of complex reasoning chains and evidence hierarchies.
- **Visual Traceability:** Use distinct visual cues, such as node-and-link diagrams, to represent the 8-move grammar reasoning trace.
- **System Status Transparency:** Confidence levels and specific policy sources must always be visible to ensure user trust.

## Visual Identity & Craft
- **Expert-Facing Aesthetic:** Clean, functional, and authoritative.
- **Polished & Pixel-Perfect:** The interface must feel modern, attractive, and high-quality.
- **Advanced CSS Usage:** Utilize subtle animations, transitions, and sophisticated styling to enhance the user experience and convey a sense of modern software craftsmanship.

## Technical Constraints & Standards
- **Desktop-First Optimization:** The UI is primarily designed for high-resolution desktop monitors to accommodate detailed maps and multi-document review.
- **WCAG 2.1 AA (Aspirational):** While desktop-first, the system should strive for standard accessibility practices to ensure inclusivity within the planning authority.
