# Product Guide

## Vision
The Planner’s Assistant is a procedurally explainable planning judgement system designed to build trust between AI and human planners. It primarily supports Local Plan Production and Development Management by providing transparent, legally defensible reasoning traces for complex decisions, rather than "black box" outputs.
