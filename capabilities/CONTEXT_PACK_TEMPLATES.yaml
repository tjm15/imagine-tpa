title: Context Pack Templates
description: >
  Planner-legible heuristics for Context Assembly. These templates guide retrieval-frame
  generation and candidate coverage for different work modes and CULP stages.

  They are deliberately "soft": they do not decide outcomes. They bias Context Assembly
  toward reasonable evidence coverage (including counter-evidence) and executable
  tool requests across text + spatial + visual modalities.

  Modes:
    - plan_studio: local plan / spatial strategy work (CULP aligned)
    - casework: development management work (applications / officer reports)

defaults:
  max_global_queries_per_template: 8
  max_instrument_hints_per_template: 6
