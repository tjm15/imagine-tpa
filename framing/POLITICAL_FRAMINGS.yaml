  Political framing presets used to condition the system's suggestions and narration.
  A user selects one of these presets; Move 1 produces a run-specific `Framing` object
  referencing `political_framing_id` (see schemas/Framing.schema.json).

political_framings:
  - political_framing_id: high_growth
    title: "High Growth / Housing Delivery"
    description: >
      Prioritise meeting needs quickly, maximise housing delivery, and accept higher change
      where necessary, while still addressing key statutory/environmental constraints.
    default_goals:
      - "Maximise housing delivery and speed of delivery."
      - "Prioritise accessibility and infrastructure unlocks that support growth."
    default_constraints:
      - "Avoid unlawful / undeliverable allocations."
      - "Respect absolute constraints (e.g., Habitats Regulations) where applicable."
    non_goals:
      - "Optimising for minimum visible change."

  - political_framing_id: climate_nature
    title: "Climate & Nature First"
    description: >
      Prioritise carbon reduction, biodiversity net gain, flood resilience, and nature recovery;
      treat growth as conditional on robust mitigation and adaptation.
    default_goals:
      - "Minimise emissions and lock in resilience."
      - "Strengthen biodiversity and green/blue infrastructure networks."
    default_constraints:
      - "Avoid strategies that rely on weak or unproven mitigation."
    non_goals:
      - "Maximising short-term unit counts at any cost."

  - political_framing_id: regeneration_brownfield
    title: "Regeneration / Brownfield First"
    description: >
      Concentrate growth in existing urban areas and previously developed land, supporting town
      centre renewal and infrastructure re-use, before considering peripheral expansion.
    default_goals:
      - "Prioritise brownfield and underused urban land."
      - "Support town centre vitality and reuse of infrastructure."
    default_constraints:
      - "Avoid dispersal that undermines regeneration objectives."
    non_goals:
      - "Greenfield expansion as the default."

  - political_framing_id: landscape_heritage
    title: "Landscape / Heritage Protection"
    description: >
      Prioritise the protection of landscape character, heritage assets, and setting; accept lower
      growth if the alternative implies substantial harm.
    default_goals:
      - "Avoid substantial harm to heritage significance and landscape character."
      - "Direct growth to locations with lower sensitivity."
    default_constraints:
      - "Require strong evidence and mitigation for any harm."
    non_goals:
      - "Treating heritage/landscape impacts as minor by default."

  - political_framing_id: infrastructure_first
    title: "Infrastructure-Led Growth"
    description: >
      Prioritise deliverability and infrastructure capacity (transport, schools, utilities),
      focusing allocations where infrastructure can realistically be funded and delivered.
    default_goals:
      - "Align growth with funded infrastructure delivery."
      - "Reduce risk of undeliverable allocations."
    default_constraints:
      - "Avoid options that assume speculative infrastructure without a credible pathway."
    non_goals:
      - "Allocating sites that are unlikely to deliver within the plan period."
