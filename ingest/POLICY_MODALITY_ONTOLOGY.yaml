title: Policy Modality Ontology
scope: "UK local plan policy text (authority-specific, often intentionally under-specified)"
principle: >
  The extractor does not decide; it characterises. Outputs here are *not* "requirements" or
  determinations. They are planner-legible descriptors of how policy language is framed.
