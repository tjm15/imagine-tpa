# HTML Composer Specification

## Core capability
The composer renders **publishable HTML** from structured artefacts. Rendering is deterministic
and traceable; it does not infer new facts.

## Surfaces
1. **Internal workspace** (auth later): renders judgement sheets and working artefacts for the
   Planner's Assistant UI.
2. **Public portal app** (no auth): renders only published artefacts and statutory pages.

The public portal is a **separate app**. The composer only supplies HTML (and any required
JSON-LD or embedded metadata) for that app to serve.

## Output types
* Notice pages (HTML-first).
* Gateway self-assessment pages (HTML-first, immutable after publish).
* Consultation summaries and materials.
* Plan-as-webpages (policies, evidence index, maps).
* Scenario/Judgement sheets (internal; public only when explicitly published).

## Accessibility and compliance
* Public-facing HTML must meet WCAG 2.2 AA.
* Use semantic HTML and descriptive link text.
* Include machine-readable metadata where required by planning.data standards.

## Policies map integration
* The public portal must expose an interactive policies map with click-through to policy pages.
* The map must be able to surface evidence cards and overlays generated by the render pipeline.

## Technology constraints
* The composer is **not** tied to a specific template engine or CSS system.
* It may be implemented as static export, SSR, or hybrid, provided it preserves the publishable
  HTML requirement.
* Progressive enhancement is preferred; content must remain usable without JS.
