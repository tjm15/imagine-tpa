<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This place portrait provides the baseline evidence for Cambridge's local plan review under the new plan process. It establishes the current context against which spatial strategy options will be assessed.</p>
<p>The portrait draws on multiple evidence sources including Census 2021, local monitoring data, and commissioned technical studies. All limitations are explicitly noted.</p>

<h2>Housing Context</h2>
<p>Cambridge faces acute housing pressure. The affordability ratio of 12.8x significantly exceeds both the regional average (8.2x) and represents a deterioration from 10.5x in 2015.</p>
<p>As shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong> (housing trajectory), delivery has averaged 1,200 homes per annum since 2015, but the updated standard method indicates a need for 1,800 dpa to 2041.</p>

<h2>Transport & Connectivity</h2>
<p>Cambridge benefits from strong rail connectivity to London (50 mins) and excellent local cycling infrastructure. However, strategic road capacity remains constrained, particularly on the A14 corridor.</p>
<p>Spatial options will need to balance brownfield intensification (supporting sustainable modes) against greenfield release (requiring highway mitigation).</p>`;

<h2>01. Site &amp; Proposal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Address: 45 Mill Road, Cambridge CB1 2AD</li>
  <li>Ward: Petersfield</li>
  <li>Applicant: Mill Road Developments Ltd</li>
  <li>Agent: Smith Planning Associates</li>
</ul>
<p>The application site comprises a ground floor retail unit (Use Class E) within a two-storey building in the Mill Road District Centre. The proposal seeks to change the use to residential (2 x 1-bed flats), with internal alterations but no external changes.</p>
<h2>02. Planning Assessment</h2>
<h3>Principle of Development</h3>
<p>Policy DM12 requires retention of ground floor retail uses in District Centres unless the unit has been actively marketed for 12 months. Marketing evidence shows 15 months of offers at market rates with no uptake.</p>
<h3>Residential Amenity</h3>
<p>The proposed flats meet minimum space standards (Policy H9) and benefit from rear courtyard access. Natural light to habitable rooms is adequate based on the site inspection.</p>
<h3>Comments and Conditions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Highways: No objection; requires secure cycle storage.</li>
  <li>Conservation: Satisfied with internal conversion approach.</li>
  <li>Evidence source: Site visit 12 Dec.</li>
</ul>
<h2>03. Recommendation</h2>
<p><strong>APPROVE</strong>, subject to conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Secure cycle storage (2 spaces)</li>
  <li>Removal of permitted development rights</li>
  <li>Retention of front elevation details</li>
</ul>`;
