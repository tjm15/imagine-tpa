# CONSTITUTION

**System**: Procedurally Explainable Planning Judgement System
**Version**: 1.0 (Scaffolding)
**Date**: Dec 2025

## 1. Objective
Build a planning judgement system that **imitates the grammar of planning judgement**, making reasoning legible and contestable through explicit moves and logged artefacts. It serves both development management and plan-making.

The single reasoning spine is expressed across **three pipelines**:
* Spatial Strategy (plan-making / scenarios)
* Development Management (casework)
* Monitoring & Delivery (live monitoring + statutory reporting)

These capabilities are catalogued in `capabilities/CAPABILITIES_CATALOGUE.yaml`.

## 2. Non-Goals
* **Not a Decision Engine**: The system produces *conditional suggestions* and *considerations*, never final decisions.
* **Not a Black Box**: "Because the AI said so" is a failure state. All outputs must be traceable to evidence via the move grammar.
* **Not a "Cockpit"**: The dashboard is a process navigator, not a generic analytics dashboard.
* **Not Hybrid at Runtime**: A deployment is **strictly** either "Fully Azure" or "Fully OSS". No mixing providers at runtime.

## 3. Core Constraints
### 3.1 The 8-Move Grammar (Non-negotiable)
All logic must map to one of these moves:
1. Framing
2. Issue Surfacing
3. Evidence Curation
4. Evidence Interpretation
5. Considerations Formation
6. Weighing & Balance
7. Negotiation & Alteration
8. Positioning & Narration

### 3.2 UI Freeze
The canonical UI is the **Dashboard / Digital Case Officer** workspace described in `ux/DASHBOARD_IA.md`.

* The primary surface is the **Living Document** (writing/editing) with contextual sidebar support.
* **Judgement Mode** remains the explainability surface: infographic-style **Scenario/Judgement Sheets** generated by deterministic renderers from structured objects.
* Progressive enhancement only; no “analytics cockpit” views that bypass the grammar outputs.

### 3.3 Political Framing Requirement
Every position/trajectory must be explicitly conditional on a political framing (e.g., "Under a high-growth framing...").

### 3.4 Magpie Instruments
External models (flood tools, connectivity, etc.) are used as **evidence instruments**. Their inputs and outputs are logged; they are not "engines" that drive the system.

### 3.5 Traceability
* **Policy/law/factual claims** must cite `EvidenceRef`.
* **Discretionary judgement** is allowed under explicit political framing and is traced via context bundles, tool runs, prompt versions, and output verbosity (not forced citations).
* Every gap filling must be an explicit `Assumption`.
* "Explainability" = Traceable procedure and context bundles, not model weights.

## 4. Provider Profiles
The system supports two distinct profiles defined by the `ProviderProfile` contract:
1. **Fully Azure** (Imagine Cup compliant)
2. **Fully OSS** (Self-hosted)

These are mutually exclusive at runtime.
